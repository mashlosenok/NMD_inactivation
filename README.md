# NMD_inactivation
Hub of UCSC browser tracks with data from NMD inactivation experiments. 
Contains also experiments with knockdown and overexpression of QKI and ILF2 RBPs. NMD was inactivated with cycloheximide (CHX). 

For each junction found by IPSA (J6/J4 file) the tracks show the number of split reads and the total number continuous reads spanning donor and acceptor splice sites. Each event's name is "split reads|continuous reads". 

## To use:
- In [UCSC genome browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/) go to My Data -> Track Hubs -> Connected Hubs. Past https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mashlosenok/NMD_inactivation/main/hub.txt URL and press "Add Hub". The tracks are for GRCh38/hg38 assembly.
- Scroll down to "CHX_junctions" hub and change display mode for the tracks you are interested in.
