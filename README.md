# NMD_inactivation
Hub of UCSC browser tracks with data from NMD inactivation experiments. 
Contains also experiments with knockdown and overexpression of QKI and ILF2 RBPs. NMD was inactivated with cycloheximide (CHX). 

Tracks show counts of split reads supporting all splice junctions, found by IPSA (by default, J6/J4 file).

## To use:
In UCSC genome browser go to My Data -> Track Hubs -> Connected Hubs. 
Past https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mashlosenok/NMD_inactivation/main/hub.txt URL and press "Add Hub". The tracks are for GRCh38/hg38 assembly.
